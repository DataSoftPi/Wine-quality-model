This script is all about diving into the data related to wine quality. It starts by bringing in the tools we need, then it opens up a file that contains information like volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, quality ratings, etc.

Next,  it checks for missing information and fills in the blanks as well as creates a few graphs that help us with the EDA.

The script also contains a hypothesis test and the ANOVA test to help us understand how features like acidity or pH levels are correlated with the wine quality (spoiler alert: They do.)

The script then brings in a Support Vector Classifier model, which we utilize as a virtual wine taster. It trains this model on the data, and fine-tunes its parameters using a method called GridSearchCV.

Finally, it puts the model to the test and gives us an accuracy report, ensuring it's making predictions accurately without overfitting the data.
